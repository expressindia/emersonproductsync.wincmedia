Hello Mohammed, Here are the instructions for the subdomain and DB 

Step Zero: 
    - create github repo for this site/project

Step One:  
    - import Emerson Database into wincmedi_CuratedSupplementsProducts
        - API Docs located here: https://www.emersonproductsync.wincmedia.com/emerson-api-docs/
        - Product Data endpoint is in a .txt file called "endpoint.txt"
        - Schema outline located here: https://www.emersonproductsync.wincmedia.com/schema-docs/
    
Step Two:
    - provide access to database through DatabaseForm.php (or another page)
    - allow a user to select product by SKU
    - allow a user to select group of products by brand
    - display data in a useful manner (we can work on this together)
